# pytorch-jetson
This repo contains a bash script to automate the process of installing (and setting up) the PyTorch wheel for the NVIDIA Jetson series of devices, particularly the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano. It is meant to serve as an alternative to the tedious official documentation provided by NVIDIA.

**Current status of the script:** In progress of being tested on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano

Disclaimer: as goes with general internet advice, do not run random bash scripts downloaded off the internet. Make sure you double-check everything. Additionally, this script has not, and will probably never, be mass-tested on all kinds of jetson devices, not only due to lack of hardware but also changing documentation from NVIDIA's side. Please be sure to check the official documentation to see if any updates have been made.

Disclosure: this script was hacked together from instructions compiled after hours of work scratching our heads on documentation. It is extracted from the documentation and converted to bash scripts by real humans, but in assistance with Gemini 3.
